jpacman
=======

JPacMan is a Java implementation of the popular [Pac-Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man) game
and new iteration of Arie van Deursen's [jpacman-framework](https://github.com/avandeursen/jpacman-framework).

The primary purpose of this project is to serve as a code base used to teach software testing and engineering.
With this in mind, the code is only partially tested, whereas some parts of the code remain untested intentionally.

As a student in software testing and engineering, you can extend the existing test suites,
or use this code base to build your own extensions in a test-driven way.
As a teacher, you can use the code base to create your exercises or demonstrations.

The first iterations of this code have been developed and used by [Arie van Deursen](https://github.com/avandeursen)
for a software testing course at Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands.
Teachers interested in seeing the exercises he uses there are invited to contact him.

Other universities who have used this material include Antwerp, Eindhoven, and UBC (Vancouver).

This iteration of the code has been developed by myself in collaboration with Arie van Deursen,
mainly to improve the previous code base and develope a new series of exercises suitable for first year students.
